            <h1>PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h1>

            <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

            <p>This privacy statement concerns the collection and publication of personal data, in particular names
                and contact details as well as photos, on publicly accessible Commission websites such as
                Codeweek.eu, of persons who serve as contact points for Commission activities (Code Week
                ambassadors, Educational Ministry Coordinators, Leading Teachers, activity and event
                organisers and general users of Code Week website) and for that purpose have given their consent
                to the processing of their personal data</p>

            <p>This privacy statement explains the reason for the collection and processing, the way we collect,
                handle and ensure protection of all personal data provided, how that information is used and what
                rights you may exercise in relation to your data (the right to access, rectify, block etc.).</p>

            <p>
                The European institutions are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. As this
                service/application collects and further processes personal data, Regulation (EC)
                N°45/2001<sup><a href="#footer">1</a></sup>
                and the
                upcoming equivalent data protection rules for the European institutions and bodies (hereafter the
                ‘Internal Data Protection Regulation’<sup><a href="#footer">2</a></sup>
                ) are applicable.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Why do we process your data?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <span class="underline">Purpose of the processing operation:</span> The European Commission collects
                and publishes your personal
                information to facilitate the identification of contact points by stakeholders or project/programme
                beneficiaries. Offering real persons as contact points is often the best and most efficient way to
                ensure that interested people can get in contact with Commission services.

            <ul>
                <li>article 5 (a): processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
                    interest,
                    namely the implementation of the EU Code Week as part of the Digital Single Market Strategy. It
                    is
                    therefore lawful under Article 5(a) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and the upcoming Internal Data
                    Protection Regulation.
