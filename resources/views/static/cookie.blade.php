            <h3><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h3>

            <p>
            <div>A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit
                the site.
            </div>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>First party cookies</strong> are cookies set by the website you’re visiting. Only that
                        website can read
                        them. In addition, a website might potentially use external services, which also set their own
                        cookies, known as <strong>third-party cookies</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Persistent cookies are cookies saved on your computer and that are not deleted automatically
                        when you quit your browser, unlike a session cookie, which is deleted when you quit your
                        browser.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <p>
                First time you visit the Codeweek website, you will be prompted to <strong>accept or refuse
                    cookies</strong>.</p>

            <p>The purpose is to enable the site to remember your preferences (such as user name, language, etc.) for a
                certain period of time.</p>

            <p>That way, you don’t have to re-enter them when browsing around the site during the same visit.</p>

            <p>Cookies can also be used to establish anonymised statistics about the browsing experience on our
                sites.</p>
            </p>


            <h3><strong>How do we use cookies?</strong></h3>

            <p>Codeweek mostly use “first-party cookies”. These are cookies set and controlled by
                us, not by any external organisation.</p>

            <p>However, to view some of our pages, you will have to accept cookies from external organisations.</p>

            <div>The <strong>3 types of first-party cookie</strong> we use are to:
                <ul>
                    <li>store visitor preferences</li>
                    <li>make our websites operational</li>
                    <li>gather analytics data (about user behaviour)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Visitor preferences</h4>
            <p>These are set by us and only we can read them. They remember:

            <ul>
                <li>if you have agreed to (or refused) this site’s cookie policy</li>

            </ul>
            </p>
