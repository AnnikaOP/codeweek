                        Are you considering participating in EU Code Week but you don’t know where to start from?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here you can find free training materials & resources that will help you get started and plan your next innovative lesson.

                        No previous experience on coding or programming is needed, each module takes only around 15’ to go through, and they introduce you to key concepts related to coding and computational thinking activities. Besides, the modules also give you practical tips and advices on how to integrate them in your classroom.
                    </p>
