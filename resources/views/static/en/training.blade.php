                        Here you can find our new training materials for teachers. Each of them introduces you to key concepts related to coding and computational thinking activities, and gives you practical examples on how to integrate them in your lesson.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You do not need to have any experience of coding or programming to follow these short modules, so do give them a try. It takes only about 15 minutes to go through each of them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These materials are kindly made available by an international team of trainers, teachers and experts. Stay tuned for more to come.
                    </p>
