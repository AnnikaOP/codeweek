                        The Code Week 4 All challenge encourages you to link your activities with those organised by colleagues, friends, or other contacts. Together you will earn the Code Week Certificate of Excellence.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Who is it for?</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Code Week 4 All challenge is open to anyone organising an activity within the framework of the EU Code Week 2018. An activity can be a lesson on coding, a workshop, an event or even an online webinar. The Code Week 4 All challenge allows you to go further than just participation. It encourages engagement with other schools and organisations by building a network, an informal alliance of activities, or by co-organising events with others.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is it?</h2>

                    <p>
                        In addition to submitting your activity to the EU Code Week map, you can engage others to do the same. When the activity you pinned on the Code Week map is approved, you will receive an automatically generated Code Week 4 All code. Share this code with your fellow event organisers, so that they can insert it into the CODE WEEK 4 ALL CODE field when they register their activities via the registration form.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the activities have been carried out, if you and your group report back and reach one of the following thresholds, you will all earn the Code Week Certificate of Excellence!
